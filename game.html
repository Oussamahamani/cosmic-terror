        <h2>The story </h2>
        <p id="demo">
            It is the year 3000,  Humanity has became so technological advanced, even so this didn't make
            healthcare any cheaper but even more expensive and out of the reach of the normal population especially when
            you catch something called stardust syndrome. A disease where your eyes get shiny white grains on them, and
            they will increase and became bigger until you became blind and die.<br>
            Your beloved is one of those unfortunate ones who had caught the disease. Even selling everything you had
            wasnt not enough to cover cost of her treatment, Seeing her health regresses and her death getting more
            imminent by the day you decided that you can't bear this anymore. But selling drugs like walter white wasn't
            a viable business in the year 3000 , so you decided to enroll in the particle program, a space program where
            you have to reach the end of the universe, to reach the border, if there is one.<br>
            A journey which no one has ever came back from. but if you can make it, everything will be paid for, so you
            leave your beloved frozen in a Cryonics, waiting for you tens, hundreds, and even thousands of years for
            you, until you meet each other again. </p>
            <h3>how to control the game</h3>

When⠀i⠀woke⠀up,⠀I⠀found⠀out⠀that⠀i⠀was⠀teleported⠀back⠀next⠀to⠀earth⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But⠀it⠀was⠀not⠀the⠀same⠀earth⠀you⠀have⠀left,⠀it⠀was⠀the⠀desolate⠀a⠀planet⠀with⠀no⠀bleu⠀on⠀it.
with⠀no⠀life⠀ on it.⠀While⠀on⠀your⠀journey,⠀time⠀passed⠀diffrently⠀on⠀earth.
Millions⠀of⠀years⠀has⠀passed,⠀leaving⠀your⠀dreams,⠀leaving⠀your⠀life⠀as⠀black⠀as⠀earth⠀is⠀now.
For⠀the⠀reason⠀you⠀decided⠀to⠀embark⠀on⠀your⠀journey,⠀has⠀also⠀dissipeared.

before⠀you⠀lost⠀yourself⠀more⠀to⠀ddespairr⠀
you⠀received⠀another⠀transmission⠀from⠀the⠀enitiy⠀offering⠀you⠀to⠀guide⠀you⠀to⠀your⠀planet,⠀in⠀a⠀journey
through⠀time⠀and⠀space,⠀even⠀more⠀stranger⠀than⠀your⠀first.
you⠀didn't⠀dare⠀to⠀ask⠀what⠀the⠀price⠀will⠀be⠀as⠀you⠀started⠀your⠀second⠀trip.⠀⠀⠀
what⠀the⠀entity⠀decided⠀to⠀help,⠀what⠀he⠀is⠀expecting⠀in⠀return⠀⠀⠀
