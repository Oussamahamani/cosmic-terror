## About


- Space survival action shooting game where you have to evade meteors and other enemies, and use your shots wisely to survive.

- This project is build using Html, Css, Javascript and Canvas.
- Tried to add creative vision of the endless shooting game genre, by adding more focus on evasion, resources managment, and story.


## Story
It is the year 3000,  Humanity has become so technologically advanced, even so this didn't make   healthcare any cheaper but even more expensive and out of the reach of the normal population, especially when you catch something called stardust syndrome. A disease where your eyes get shiny white grains on them, and    they will increase and became bigger until you became blind and die.<br>  Your beloved is one of those unfortunate ones who had caught the disease. Even selling everything you had wasn't not enough to cover cost of her treatment, Seeing her health regresses and her death getting more imminent by the day you decided that you can't bear this anymore. But selling drugs like walter white wasn't a viable business in the year 3000 , so you decided to enroll in the particle program, a space program where you have to reach the end of the universe, to reach the border, if there is one.<br>A journey which no one has ever come back from. but if you can make it, everything will be paid for, so you leave your beloved frozen in a Cryonics, waiting for you tens, hundreds, and even thousands of years for you, until you meet each other again.

## Unresolved issues and bugs
* The shots clear other objects, even if they don't collide with them. The issue may have stemmed from the Collision Detection algorithm i have used, so i tried using other algorithms but none of them worked so far.
* The game take a little too long to load on the first visit, this may have been caused by the size of the code.
* The ship and objects size gets smaller if you have a monitor with bigger resolution, or if you zoom out.
* The game is resource heavy, which may not play well on computer with not good enough specs.

## Future Plans
* Make the game playable on the mobile.
* Adding bosses fights for each level.
* Making the game longer.
* Creating a second game to complete the story, as this game ends in cliffhanger.
* Adding multiplayer to the game.
* Adding a cutscene at the end of the game, instead of just narrating the events.
* Adding more abilities to the ship, like a shield and other type of shots.
* Giving the player the option to upgrade the ship and its abilities.
