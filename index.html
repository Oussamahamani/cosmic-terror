        <h2>The story so far</h2>
        <p>
            It is the year 3000, Humanity has became so technological advanced, even so this didn't make healthcare any cheaper but even more expensive and out of the reach of the normal population especially when you catch something called stardust syndrome. A disease where your eyes get shiny white grains on them, and they will increase and became bigger until you became blind and die.<br>
            Your beloved is one of those unfortunate ones who had caught the disease. Even selling everything you had wasnt not enough to cover cost of her treatment, Seeing her health regresses and her death getting more eminent by the day you decided that you can't bear this anymore. But selling drugs like walter white wasn't a viable business in the year 3000 , so you decided to enroll in the particle program, a space program where you have to reach the end of the universe, to reach the border.<br>
            A journey which no one has ever came back from. but if you can make it, everything will be paid for, so you leave your beloved frozen in a Cryonics, waiting for you tens, hundreds, and even thousands of years for you to meet each other again.        </p>
